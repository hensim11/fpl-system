# Architecture decisions

This file records decisions that shape the foundation. New decisions should be appended with their context and consequences.

## 001 — Use a small Python package and standard library

Status: accepted for Milestone 1.

The repository needs one reliable ingestion path, not an application framework. The package separates HTTP access, validation, transformation, persistence, and CLI concerns. Python's `urllib`, `json`, `csv`, `pathlib`, and `unittest` cover the current need, so runtime dependencies remain empty.

Consequence: setup and execution are simple. A third-party HTTP/dataframe library can be added later if retries, richer typing, larger data, or analyst workflows justify it.

## 002 — Treat raw snapshots as immutable inputs

Status: accepted.

Each run writes full responses beneath `data/raw/<UTC snapshot id>/` and derived tables beneath the matching `data/processed/<UTC snapshot id>/`. Existing snapshot paths are never overwritten.

Consequence: transformations remain reproducible and upstream fields are not lost. Generated data is ignored by Git and needs a separate retention/backup policy if it becomes operationally important.

## 003 — Use CSV for processed Milestone 1 tables

Status: accepted.

CSV is inspectable, portable, and requires no optional engine. Current data volume is small enough that its weaker typing and larger size are acceptable.

Consequence: downstream readers must apply data types. Reassess Parquet when historical or gameweek-level data makes stronger schemas and columnar storage valuable.

## 004 — Validate a minimum upstream contract

Status: accepted.

The FPL endpoints are not a versioned developer contract. Validation therefore targets fields and relationships required by our transformations rather than mirroring every upstream field.

Consequence: irrelevant upstream additions do not break ingestion, while missing keys, duplicate IDs, and invalid references fail before a misleading snapshot is saved.

## 005 — Keep FPL rules out of the data layer

Status: accepted.

Milestone 1 copies current facts and does not implement scoring, squad, pricing, transfer, chip, or deadline logic. When product logic needs those rules, season-specific values and effective dates will be supplied through versioned configuration.

Consequence: models will not silently embed rules that change between seasons. A configuration format will be selected only when the first real rule-backed use case is defined.

## 006 — Use the public endpoints consumed by the FPL website

Status: accepted with risk.

`bootstrap-static/` and `fixtures/` provide the smallest useful current player/team/fixture foundation without credentials or aggregation by a third party.

Consequence: the project depends on an unofficially supported and unversioned schema. Raw preservation, validation, clear errors, and tests reduce—but do not remove—that risk.
